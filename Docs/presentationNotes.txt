Presentation notes
	Goal: Entertaining and perhaps show people something they can take away and use.
	
	First slide:  Name, github, email, programgood.net.  Based on designs in series: Inmar link  (Book link too)
				
	be like pluralsight dude
		straight into code!
		
	Intro: C# developer.. work for an Edinburgh company. 8 developers.  30 Infrastructure.. 
		   Write line of business apps for companies.  Larger companies now, and larger projects
		   Problems I encounter:
				Slow to get to understand project as business logic everywhere 
					eg codebehind in webforms
					Stored procs
				Performance issues
				No unit tests so hard to change
	
	Humour: side project to explore good architecture and design
		
	Demo of site... what it does?
		Show jokes
			sort by..
		Edit
			validation
		Create
		Delete
		Responsive design
	
	Show objects diagram (simple)
		Story
		StoryType(Enum)
		Vote
	
	VS2013 
	Naming conventions and directory structure
	Git integration
	
	Unit tests - model
		Ctrl ,
	
		Ctrl R + T
		Alt E I O A
		
		FluentAssertions
	
	Integration Tests - repository
	
	Mvc Tests
		as ViewResult
		
	4. Building a Model
		**CanAddStoryUsingContext - easy to grok
		
		Entites vs Value Objects
		
		Enums - added in EF5 (we're on 6)
		
		Equality comparison for Story (in DomainEntity)
		
		Collections - Didn't expose List<T> or IQueryable as can't ovverride
		
		AutoTrack of DateCreated and DateModified
		
		Generic Repo
		
		Extensive test for Model
		
		****Mapping:
	
	5. EF	
		****HumourContext.. strategy.. use web.config for prod to say disableDatabaseInitialization=true
								and tests true.
							how to set live settings for DB
								is defaulting to SQLEXPRESS
							
		
		UoW - make multiple changes to your data and then submit to the database all at once.
				so basically don't do a savechanges in my code
				
		
		HumourContextFactory
		
		StoryConfiguration - business rules
		
		IDateTracking
	
	6. MVC
		Strcturemap - IoC
		
		ViewModels - 1 for View and 1 for Create/Edit/Del
		
		AutoMapper
	
		****Paging and Sorting - DynamicQuery library
			good test in StoryControllerTests
			
			order by date.
			order by rating..default
